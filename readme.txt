A program that steal firefox passwords and sends it to server . The code is based on the original work of Renato Alves . This is the link: https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt .  I modified his code and added network functionality made it less verbose and removed unnecessary code . To use it go to line 512 and add your website . This will need a php script to which can write a passwords sent by this program by post request .
